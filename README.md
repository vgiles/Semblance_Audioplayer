2. Notation.
3. This player.

**Requirements:**

1. Laptop with pd-extended
2. Three sets of headphones/earphones (that allow instrument sounds through).
3. Audio interface with at least three mono outputs
4. At least three mono-feed headphone amp or other feeder system with multiple inputs.

**Notes:**

There are two patch files here. The first: *Semblance_Audioscore.pd* corresponds to the first zip file below and is for rehearsal, if necessary. It includes click tracks for each player and the audio is broken up into sections. The second: *Master_Audioplayer.pd* is for performance, and corresponds to the second zip file below which has all audio as one feed for each player, with only structural points highlighted with clicks. There is a slow 2/4 count-in for instrument 1, and then each section or temp change is preceeded with two measures of clicks and concluded with one measure in the new section or tempo.
